Each of the programming languages you mentioned has its own strengths and characteristics that make it suitable for different aspects of distributed systems. Let's take a look at each language and its relevance to learning about distributed systems:

1. **Erlang and Elixir:**
   Erlang was designed with distributed systems in mind, and it excels in building fault-tolerant and highly concurrent systems. Elixir, which runs on the Erlang VM (BEAM), provides a more modern and approachable syntax while retaining the concurrency and distribution features. These languages are often used in telecom, real-time messaging, and distributed applications where fault tolerance and high availability are critical.

   **Pros:** Concurrency, fault tolerance, hot code swapping, lightweight processes.
   **Cons:** Learning curve due to unique concurrency model, less common outside specific domains.

2. **Go (Golang):**
   Go was designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. It offers built-in concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) that make it easy to write concurrent and distributed programs. Go is used in various domains, and its straightforward syntax makes it suitable for building microservices and distributed systems.

   **Pros:** Concurrency primitives, simplicity, strong community support.
   **Cons:** Fewer built-in features for distributed systems compared to Erlang/Elixir.

3. **Java:**
   Java is a widely used programming language with a robust ecosystem and extensive libraries for building distributed systems. It offers the Java Concurrency Framework for managing concurrency and provides tools for building both traditional distributed systems and modern microservices.

   **Pros:** Mature ecosystem, extensive libraries, established in enterprise systems.
   **Cons:** More verbose syntax compared to Go and Elixir.

In terms of industry usage and standards, Java has a strong presence in enterprise systems and has been used in building large-scale distributed applications for years. Erlang and Elixir are popular in domains that require high concurrency and fault tolerance, such as telecommunications and messaging platforms. Go has gained popularity in building modern web services, microservices, and cloud-native applications.

If you're looking to learn about distributed systems in a more academic context or focus on fault tolerance and concurrency, Erlang and Elixir might be interesting choices. If you're aiming for broader industry applicability and want to explore both traditional and microservices-based distributed systems, Java and Go are solid options.

Remember that the choice of programming language is just one aspect of learning about distributed systems. Understanding fundamental concepts like communication, coordination, consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability is more important. Whichever language you choose, the key is to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and gain practical experience.
